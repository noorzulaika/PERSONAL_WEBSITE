    <p style="color: white; font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px">Family is a part of one’s life. It doesn’t matter if you have a small or large family, as long as you have one. The family serves as the first school to children where one learns about various things. My family has always been by my side in love and grief. They have taught me how to be a better person. My family consists of four siblings and my parents. In every member of the family, lies my strength. My mother's name is Fauziah Binti Yaacob and my father's name is Manas bin Hasan. My mother is my core strength because I can always rely on her when I need a shoulder to cry on. She believes in me more than anyone else. She is the backbone of our family. My father is a man who always hide his troubles for the sake of his family. His is self - employed. I have four siblings, two boys and two girls. The first is named Mohammad Zahir. The second is Noor Affza Erna, the third is Mohammad Zaiman and the last is myself Noor Zulaika. They are all already working and I am the only one who is still studying. My siblings are my best friends whom I have always loved. My family is my power that continues to push me to higher levels. In short, I will forever be indebted to my family for all they have done to me. I can’t imagine my life without them. They were my first teacher and my first friend. They are responsible for creating a safe and secure environment for me at home. I can share everything with my family because we never judge each other. We believe in the power of love over everything and that drives us to help each other to become better human beings.</p>
